# Troubleshooting Codex Usage

## Taskbar error labels

Codex Usage keeps authentication failures separate from transient service failures:

| Simplified Chinese | Other languages | Meaning | Recommended action |
|---|---|---|---|
| `!` | `!` | Enabled service credentials are missing or expired | Sign in with the relevant CLI/app, then refresh Codex Usage. Claude Desktop login does not count as Claude Code CLI login. |
| `网络` | `NET` | Network or TLS connection failed | Check connectivity, VPN, proxy, and firewall settings |
| `限流` | `429` | Provider rate limit | Wait for the provider retry window; Codex Usage retries with backoff |
| `服务` | `5XX` | Provider service failure | Wait and retry; check provider status if it persists |
| `错误` | `ERR` | Invalid or unsupported response | Enable diagnostics and inspect the log |

Authentication failures pause provider polling until the credential source changes, preventing repeated login notifications. Transient failures use exponential backoff up to the configured refresh interval.

## Windows proxy after restart

Codex Usage uses proxy environment variables when configured, and otherwise reads the enabled Windows system proxy. This lets startup and Explorer launches use the same proxy without requiring terminal-only `HTTP_PROXY` or `HTTPS_PROXY` variables. Automatic proxy configuration scripts (PAC) are not supported; use a manual Windows proxy or proxy environment variables.

## Diagnostic log

Run:

```powershell
codex-usage.exe --diagnose
```

The log is written to `%TEMP%\codex-usage.log`. It includes:

- application version and executable path
- direct or WinGet install channel
- provider failure category and retry delay
- window creation, taskbar placement, and relaunch events

The log does not include access tokens, refresh tokens, credential file contents, or API response bodies.

## Update failures

Direct installations and portable copies download only the exact `codex-usage.exe` asset and verify it against `codex-usage.exe.sha256` from the same GitHub Release. The updater keeps the previous EXE until the downloaded version has been installed and restarted successfully. If restart fails, the old EXE is restored.

WinGet-managed installations delegate upgrades to WinGet:

```powershell
winget upgrade --id Ray.CodexUsage --exact
```

## Reset local position without deleting settings

Right-click the taskbar component and choose **Settings > Reset Position**. Settings are stored at `%APPDATA%\CodexUsage\settings.json`.

By default, the widget keeps its placed position when tray icons or usage text change. **Settings > Anchor to taskbar right** instead keeps a fixed distance from the taskbar's right edge. Switching modes preserves the current position. Existing tray-relative positions are converted on first launch. New installations refresh once per minute; saved custom intervals are preserved.

## Reinstall while preserving settings

Normal uninstall keeps the settings file. Reinstalling restores the saved language, refresh interval, provider selection, widget visibility, and taskbar position. Use `uninstall.ps1 -RemoveSettings` only when a full reset is intended.
